This AddOn makes the functionality of MapNotes (Fan's Update) available within Atlas.

i.e. you can now <Control>-Click on Atlas maps to make your own notes, in just the same way that you use MapNotes to make notes on the Blizzard WorldMap

This AddOn simply uses the Plugin interface provided by MapNotes that allows notes to be created on any other WoW frames.

The code in this AddOn used to be included within the MapNotes AddOn. Why have I separated this code in to its own AddOn folder ?
Firstly, this is probably the way that this functionality should always have been implemented for the sake of clarity.
I'm also aware that a new version of Atlas will be released, and that this Plugin may not work with the new Atlas.
However, I am confident that MapNotes and Atlas can still be compatible with some small modifications to the Atlas-specific "Plugin" functions. Putting this plugin code in its own AddOn means that it can be updated and upgraded separately to the MapNotes AddOn itself, and even allows the Atlas author to provide their own Plugin code if they so wish.
